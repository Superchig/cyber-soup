									<h2>History of Cyber Security</h2>
									<p>What was mine again...? Was it with a "0", or an "o?"</p>

									<p>
										Cyber security is perhaps one the most needed and least understood part of our daily use of technology.  We make passwords and trust that the companies that hold our sensitive data will stop whatever hackers are trying to steal.  The realm of cybersecurity is a relatively new industry yet has and continues to cost billions and governments millions of dollars.  But how did we get here?
									</p>

									<h3>The 60s and 70s</h3>
									<p>
										The term Hacker originally was a term popularized in the 60s to describe people who were especially into programming and computers and were exceptionally good at it.  However, wider society had really no knowledge of what hackers were or much about the intense inner workings of computers.
The 70s brought further advancements in computers but also additional vulnerabilities.  Phone lines were now used computers to redirect calls and then came the wider use of the internet. 1971 saw the first development of malware.  Malware is software specifically designed to disrupt, harm, take control of, or damage a computer system or systems.  This new invention was originally made solely for academic purposes in universities to try to understand the inner workings of computers better.

									<h3>The 1980s</h3>
									<p>
										&emsp; Hacking sharply grew in popularity due to computers still being relatively new and cyber security usually being weak.  For the majority of the decade hacking was primarily for espionage and political gain.  Rival countries would attempt to gain access to vital military or industrial secrets.
									</p>
									<p>
										&emsp; Marcus Hess was a German citizen that was partially responsible for a growing awareness of computer vulnerabilities in the late 80s.  His most well known exploit was when he hacked into the pentagon with the intent to sell secrets to the KGB, Soviet intelligence agency.  He is believed to have compromised over 400 government computers.
									</p>
									<p>
										&emsp; Robert T Morris also contributed to the importance of cyber security.  He was curious about how many computers were connected to the internet so he devised a program that would travel from one computer to another, counting and then duplicating itself.  Mr Morris had created the first computer worm.  His experiment quickly got out of hand as the worm duplicated at an exponential rate slowing and nearly crashing the entire internet.    When he was caught, he was the first to be charged under the Computer Fraud andAbuse Act and ordered to pay a $100,000 fine.
									</p>

									<h3>The 1990s</h3>
									<p>
										&emsp; Aggressive computer viruses and hacking started to pick up and caused great amounts of damage.  Two famous viruses where the ILOVEYOU and Melissa viruses that grinded email to a halt.  More and more hackers popped up and began hacking normal institutions and individuals, but now primarily for monetary gain along with strategic objectives.
										&emsp; The out of control threat led to the rise of a dedicated cyber security industry in the early 90s.  They initially encountered several issues, many of which have not been and may never be completely resolved.  These factors still play into the cyber security dynamic today.  First is that antivirus measures work if they always work whereas a hacker only needs to get lucky once.  The process of scanning for a virus is also resource intensive, and would cause a large amount of false positives
									</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>The 2000s and 2010s</h3>
									<p>
										&emsp; The 2000s saw a continued escalation in hacking, counter measures, and different groups utilizing them to further their interests.  Credit card hacking and online scams continued to cost billions of dollars.  Some would hack large companies to steal trade secrets or their customer’s sensitive information.  Others would specifically target those who may not know better in order to scam money such as the elderly and children.
	Hacking also began to take an ideological form as different people from activists to whistle blowers used hacking as a way to achieve a desired goal.  Edward Snowden was an employee of the the US intelligence services that used hacking to controversially reveal government information, among other things, revealing illegal spying being done.  Anonymous was another “hacktivist” group, founded in 2003, dedicated to their own cause.  Best known for their use of Guy Fawks masks, their stated goal is to even the scale of what they see as corrupt elites and certain institutions.
	Hacking also began to be used to devastating effect in the goals of different groups in a political manner.  In 2007 Estonia suffered enormous infrastructure damage as hackers shut down the country’s infrastructure in steps, for 23 days.  They targeted political parties’ cyber infrastructure, news outlets, schools, universities, business, and banking system using DDos attacks.  A DDos attack is a form of cyber attack where the attack utilizes hundreds to thousands of machines to all access the same thing over and over again, causing it to crash.  The attack against the Banking system peaked at over 4 million packages a second.
	The world also saw numerous efficient uses of cyber warfare for military purposes. In 2009 a cyber worm, allegedly of US and Isreali origin, spread among Iran’s nuclear centrifuges crippling thousands of them.  This effectively hindered their contentious nuclear program.  Another example was when russian hackers used a new ukrainian military app against them.  In the midst of the armed conflict between Ukraine and Russian backed separatists, Ukraine developed an App that drastically improved the fire rate and aiming of artillery.  However, the app was compromised and used the cell phone's GPS to give the separatists exact location of military units, firing positions, and installations.
