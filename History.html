									<h2>History of Cyber Security</h2>

										Cyber security is perhaps one the most needed and least understood part of our daily use of technology.  We make passwords and trust that the companies that hold our sensitive data will stop whatever hackers are trying to steal.  The realm of cybersecurity is a relatively new industry yet has and continues to cost billions and governments millions of dollars.  But how did we get here?

									<h3>The 60s and 70s</h3>
									<p>
										The term Hacker originally was a term popularized in the 60s to describe people who were especially into programming and computers and were exceptionally good at it.  However, wider society had really no knowledge of what hackers were or much about the intense inner workings of computers.
The 70s brought further advancements in computers but also additional vulnerabilities.  Phone lines were now used computers to redirect calls and then came the wider use of the internet. 1971 saw the first development of malware.  Malware is software specifically designed to disrupt, harm, take control of, or damage a computer system or systems.  This new invention was originally made solely for academic purposes in universities to try to understand the inner workings of computers better.

									<h3>The 80s</h3>
									<p>
										Hacking sharply grew in popularity due to computers still being relatively new and cyber security usually being weak.  For the majority of the decade hacking was primarily for espionage and political gain.  Rival countries would attempt to gain access to vital military or industrial secrets.
										Marcus Hess was a German citizen and was partially responsible for a growing awareness of computer vulnerabilities in the late 80s.  His most well known exploit was when he hacked into the pentagon with the intent to sell secrets to the KGB, Soviet intelligence agency.  He is believed to have compromised over 400 government computers.
										Robert T Morris also contributed to the importance of cyber security.  He was curious about how many computers were connected to the internet so he devised a program that would travel from one computer to another, counting and then duplicating itself.  Mr Morris had created the first computer worm.  His experiment quickly got out of hand as the worm duplicated at an exponential rate slowing and nearly crashing the entire internet.    When he was caught, he was the first to be charged under the Computer Fraud andAbuse Act and ordered to pay a $100,000 fine.
