											<h2>Looks scary, doesn't it?</h2>
											<p>This is what is known as <b><i>scareware</i></b>, software which tries to scare you into doing something</p>
										</header>
										<p>
											Websites like these want you to think you have a virus so that you'll do something you wouldn't normally, <br />
											like pay money to a company or install software to "repair" the issue, which will likely install the actual virus.

											<h3>Watch out for the following, as they are most likely scareware
											</h3>
											<ul>
												<li>Popups or websites saying your phone or computer has a virus.</li>
												<li>Messages telling you have a limited amount of time to act.</li>
											</ul>

											
											<h3>What should I do when I see scareware?
											</h3>
	
											<!-- <p> -->
												<ul>
													<li>Take a breath, stay calm. Scareware, like the name implies, wants to scare you into doing things.</li>
													<li>If you're using a browser when you see the scareware, close the browser window. Some scareware wants you to think its coming
														directly from your phone or computer, but really it's just coming from a browser.
													</li>
													<li>If the scareware doesn't go away, restart your computer. Then, scan for viruses if you have any antimalware programs installed.</li>

															<h3><a>Phishing</a></h3>
															<p>
																Is when hackers try to get information from you by pretending to be something they aren't.
																The email above looks like it's from Netflix, but really it's from someone who wants to steal your data, like account name and password, or even your
																credit card information.

															<h3><a>Trojans</a></h3>
															<p>
																Trojans are programs installed by the user because they look like useful software, but are actually malware. Once a user installs a trojan,
																they can do things like record that user's data, install more malware, or give a hacker control over the device.

															<h3><a>Worms</a></h3>
															<p>
																A worm can spread itself from machine to machine automatically. This can be done over computer networks, and through email attachments. Worms 
																can modify or delete computer files, as well as replicate themselves. They can also install other programs, making the problem even worse.

													<ul>
														<li>Enable <a href = "https://www.hausmann-johnson.com/blog/the-importance-of-multifactor-authentication">multifactor authentication</a> when you can. This makes it much harder for individuals to steal your account information, making you
															less vulnerable to phishing. </li><br>
														<li>Before installing software, search it up online and make sure it's not a trojan. Also be extra careful about pirated or otherwise illegal content, as it can contain 
															malicious software without you knowing. </li><br>
														<li>Don't open email attachments from people you don't know, as they can contain worms.</li><br>
														<li>Update your software. It is annoying, but as technology ages, people find more ways to hack into it. Newer software, in general, is safer
															than older software.</li><br>
														<li>Install an antivirus if you can. There are both free and paid ones available. It is usually the case that paid antivirus software has more features than its free
															 couterpart. I't reccommended that you look at various <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-antivirus,review-2588.html#xenforo-comments-203178">antivirus softwares</a>.
