                      There are two types of people in this world: those who have forgotten their password and liars.
                      Perhaps you've been locked out of some app after entering a failed login too many times, or maybe
                      you've written your password onto a piece of paper, just so you can remember it.
                    </p>

                      <!-- TODO(Chris): Put subtitle as described below. -->

                    </span>

                    <p>
                      In any case, the problem is clear: no one can remember their passwords. And that leads to both
                      inconvenience on the part of users and incredible insecurity.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      As you can imagine, keeping your password in a sticky note by your desk maintains your access to
                      it, but also annihilates a key security element. Some
                      <a href="https://www.passwordmanager.com/password-manager-trust-survey/">2 out of 5</a>
                      Americans do just this, in fact. And yet following the onerous demands made by
                      Twitter/Facebook/whatever on your new passwords (e.g. you need a mixture of letters or numbers, or
                      you need at least one special character) leaves them mangled, cryptic, and impossible to remember.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If only there was some way to come up with hard-to-crack passwords on the fly as well as recall
                      them whenever necessary... Wait, what about password managers?
                    </p>

                    <h3>A Better Way</h3>
                    <span class="image featured"

                    <p>
                      It turns out that password managers can both give you (robust, randomly-generated) passwords and
                      securely store them. Stress-tested for the

                      these technologies have been used in daily life by a burgeoning

                      passwords.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Still, you could reasonably be concerned with the security of these password managers. If my
                      passwords are being stored on a server somewhere, what happens if that server gets hacked? Can the
                      developers of my password manager see (and steal) all of my passwords? Can a hacker steal my
                      password as it's sent to the server?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      With industry-standard communication protocols and the clever use of military-grade encryption
                      algorithms, all leading password managers provide solutions to these issues.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Are Password Managers Secure?</h3>
                    <p>
                      First, servers only ever access encrypted versions of your passswords, so they can't be accessed
                      in a data breach. If a malicious hacker or (more likely) a shifty employee steals passwords from
                      the company's database, they won't be able to use any of them, since they'll only have encrypted
                      versions of the passwords.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      How is this possible, you ask? The password manager's client program, which is often a browser
                      extension or desktop application, uses your master password (and some other cryptographic data) to
                      create a unique master key. Then, when you add new passwords into your manager, the client
                      encrypts them into a secure form before sending them to the server. When you access your passwords
                      again, the client uses the master key to decrypt your password, so that you can log in as
                      necessary.
                    </p>

                    <span class="image featured"

                      <!-- Consider putting subtitle: "Hey, atleast they can access their bank, right? Too bad any malicious coworker can too." -->
                    </span>

                    <p>
                      More specifically, this is how
                      <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/security/what-if-lastpass-gets-hacked">Lastpass</a>
                      and
                      <a href="https://bitwarden.com/help/article/what-encryption-is-used/">Bitwarden</a>, two of the
                      most popular separate password managers available, secure their passwords on the server-side. They
                      use AES 256-bit to encrypt passwords, an algorithm that was pioneered by the
                      <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/fips/nist.fips.197.pdf">Department of Defense</a>
                      and which is
                      <a
                        href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2018/09/nists-encryption-standard-has-minimum-250-billion-economic-benefit"
                      >
                        used broadly in the private sector</a
                      >. Most independent password managers use similar schemes to avoid giving the developers or
                      malicious parties usable access to anyone's passwords.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Browsers like Chrome also have their own built-in password managers. If you're signed in with a
                      Google account and store your passwords in Chrome, then a similar series of steps will protect
                      them from prying eyes. Firefox and Safari have similar protections in place.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What About My Master Password?</h3>
                    <p>
                      As we've seen, your passwords are securely encrypted with a master key (based on your master
                      password). But if you have to log in to your password manager, wouldn't the servers involved
                      necessarily need to know your master password? And in that case, won't developers still have the
                      ability to decrypt your passwords?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      This is a reasonable thought. Fortunately, the developers for all the major password managers
                      don't have this highly jeopardizing ability. Why? Servers don't have access to your master
                      password, instead authenticating with something called a hash.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Before logging in to your password manager, your client program (often a browser extension or
                      desktop application) applies a one-way cryptographic algorithm (known as a hash function) to your
                      password before sending it to the server. Essentially, this hash function takes your password and
                      transforms it into some unique, irreversible data, leaving it effectively impossible to transform
                      that unique data back into the original password.
                    </p>

                    <span class="image featured"
                      ><img src="images/passwords/Cryptographic_Hash_Function_Edited.svg" alt="" />
                      <!-- Consider putting subtitle: "Hey, atleast they can access their bank, right? Too bad any malicious coworker can too." -->
                    </span>

                    <p>
                      Rather than storing your master password itself, servers store a hashed version of the password.
                      And when you log in, your client sends a hashed form of the password to the server, which then
                      checks the two hashed values with each other. Since hashes are in effect irreversible, the hash
                      values can't be reversed to access the password. This way, you can securely authenticate without
                      the server storing your master password itself. And neither the developers nor any possible
                      malicious party can decrypt your passwords.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Making A Good (Master) Password</h2>

                    <p>
                      So password managers are both more secure and convenient than trying to keep dozens of passwords
                      in your head. Great. But they still require a master password, right? Let's look at how to create
                      secure and memorable master passwords.
                    </p>
