									<h2>Passwords</h2>
									<p>What was mine again...? Was it with a "0", or an "o?"</p>
								</header>

								<section>
									<p>
										There are two types of people in this world: those who have forgotten their
										password and liars.
										Perhaps you've been locked out of some app after entering a failed login too
										many times, or maybe you've
										written your password onto a piece of paper, just so you can remember it.
									</p>

									<span class="image featured"><img

										<!-- TODO(Chris): Put subtitle as described below. -->
										<!-- Consider putting subtitle: "Hey, atleast they can access their bank, right? Too bad any malicious coworker can too." -->
									</span>

									<p>
										In any case, the problem is clear: no one can remember their passwords. And that
										leads to both inconvenience
										on the part of users and incredible insecurity.
									</p>

									<p>
										As you can imagine, keeping your password in a sticky note by your desk
										maintains your access to it, but also annihilates a key security element.

										Some <a href="https://www.passwordmanager.com/password-manager-trust-survey/">2
											out of 5</a>
										Americans do just this, in fact.
										And yet following the onerous demands made by Twitter/Facebook/whatever on your
										new passwords (e.g. you need a mixture
										of letters or numbers, or you need at least
										one special character) leaves them mangled, cryptic, and impossible to remember.
									</p>
									<p>
										If only there was some way to come up with hard-to-crack passwords on the fly as
										well as recall them whenever necessary...
										Wait, what about password managers?
									</p>

									<h3>A Better Way</h3>
									<span class="image featured"><img
											src="https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/25/bitwarden-hero.png"
											alt="" />
										<!-- Consider putting subtitle: "Hey, atleast they can access their bank, right? Too bad any malicious coworker can too." -->
									</span>
									<p>
										It turns out that password managers can both give you (robust,
										randomly-generated) passwords and
										securely store them. Stress-tested for the <a
											href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150215005339/https://app-updates.agilebits.com/product_history/OPM2#2352">
											past 15 years
										</a>
										these technologies have been used in daily life by a burgeoning <a
											href="https://www.passwordmanager.com/password-manager-trust-survey/">21%</a>
										of Americans and a whopping
										<a
											href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/43963.pdf">73%</a>.
										of cybersecurity experts. Personally, I use one myself, where it manages over
										180 of my passwords.
									</p>
									<p>
										Still, you could reasonably be concerned with the security of these password
										managers. If my passwords are being
										stored on a server somewhere, what happens if that server gets hacked? Can the
										developers of my password manager see
										(and steal) all of my passwords? Can a hacker steal my password as it's sent to
										the server?
									</p>
									<p>
										With industry-standard communication protocols and the clever use of
										military-grade encryption algorithms,
										all leading password managers provide solutions to these issues.
									</p>

									<h3>Can They Steal My Passwords?</h3>
									<p>
										First, servers only ever access encrypted versions of your passswords, so they
										can't be accessed in a data breach.
										If a malicious hacker or (more likely) a shifty employee steals passwords from
										the company's database, they won't be
										able to use any of them, since they'll only have encrypted versions of the
										passwords.
									</p>

									<p>
										How is this possible, you ask? The password manager's client program, which is
										often a browser extension or desktop
										application, uses your master password (and some other cryptographic data) to
										create a unique master key. Then, when you
										add new passwords into your manager, the client encrypts them into a secure form
										before sending them to the server. When
										you access your passwords again, the client uses the master key to decrypt your
										password, so that you can log in as necessary.
									</p>

									<span class="image featured"><img src="images/passwords/lastpass-logo.png" alt="" />
										<!-- Consider putting subtitle: "Hey, atleast they can access their bank, right? Too bad any malicious coworker can too." -->
									</span>

									<p>
										More specifically, this is how <a
											href="https://www.lastpass.com/security/what-if-lastpass-gets-hacked">Lastpass</a>
										and
										<a
											href="https://bitwarden.com/help/article/what-encryption-is-used/">Bitwarden</a>,
										two of the most popular separate
										password managers available, secure their passwords on the server-side. They use
										AES 256-bit to encrypt passwords, an algorithm
										that was pioneered by the <a
											href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/fips/nist.fips.197.pdf">Department
											of Defense</a> and
										which is <a
											href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2018/09/nists-encryption-standard-has-minimum-250-billion-economic-benefit">
											used broadly in the private sector</a>. Most independent password managers
										use similar
										schemes to avoid giving the developers or malicious parties usable access to
										anyone's passwords.
									</p>

									<p>
										Browsers like Chrome also have their own built-in password managers. If you're
										signed in with a Google account and store
										your passwords in Chrome, then a similar series of steps will protect them from
										prying eyes. Firefox and Safari have similar
										protections in place.
									</p>

									<h3>What About My Master Password?</h3>
									<p>
										As we've seen, your passwords are securely encrypted with a master key (based on
										your master password). But if you have to
										log in to your password manager, wouldn't the servers involved necessarily need
										to know your master password? And in that case,
										won't developers still have the ability to decrypt your passwords?
									</p>

									<p>
										This is a reasonable thought. Fortunately, the developers for all the major
										password managers don't have this highly jeopardizing
										ability. Why? Servers don't have access to your master password, instead
										authenticating with something called a hash.
									</p>

									<p>
										Before logging in to your password manager, your client program (often a browser
										extension or desktop application) applies a one-way
										cryptographic algorithm (known as a hash function) to your password before
										sending it to the server. Essentially, this hash function
										takes your password and transforms it into some unique, irreversible data,
										leaving it effectively impossible to transform that unique
										data back into the original password.
									</p>

									<span class="image featured"><img
											src="images/passwords/Cryptographic_Hash_Function_Edited.svg" alt="" />
										<!-- Consider putting subtitle: "Hey, atleast they can access their bank, right? Too bad any malicious coworker can too." -->
									</span>

									<p>
										Rather than storing your master password itself, servers store a hashed version
										of the password. And when you log in, your client sends
										a hashed form of the password to the server, which then checks the two hashed
										values with each other. Since hashes are in effect
										irreversible, the hash values can't be reversed to access the password. This
										way, you can securely authenticate without the server
										storing your master password itself. And neither the developers nor any possible
										malicious party can decrypt your passwords.
									</p>

									<h2>Making A Good (Master) Password</h2>

									<p>
										So password managers are both more secure and convenient than trying to keep
										dozens of passwords in your head. Great. But they still
										require a master password, right?
									</p>
